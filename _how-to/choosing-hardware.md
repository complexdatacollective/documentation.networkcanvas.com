Choosing a device for running Interviewer is an important step in optimizing the quality of the

## Key Concerns

There are several important considerations you should keep in mind when making this decision.

The first is that **text entry is very burdensome without a physical keyboard**. When using a device without a physical keyboard (such as a tablet), the software keyboard that appears when entering text can take up more than 50% of the available screen. This leaves very little space for showing interface elements, or other data. Although features exist within the software to mitigate this (see <https://documentation.networkcanvas.com/how-to/configuring-devices/>), we still strongly recommend that you choose a device with a physical keyboard unless text entry is very minimal in your study.

The second is that you must **be mindful of your data management workflow**. How will you deploy your interview protocols (and how often will new versions be needed)? How will you get your data off of your interview devices? Different operating systems and platforms can make this process more or less difficult, and may require the use of third party tools (such as cloud providers).

The third is that **hardware performance is directly correlated with user experience**. Interviewer makes extensive use of animations and GPU intensive interactions. Using a device that has poor GPU performance will lead to stuttering and other side effects that may be perceived as unpleasant by participants, in turn leading to poorer quality data. Similarly, CPU performance will impact how long it takes to open roster interfaces which may make these functions more tedious to use.

## Overall Recommendation

For most of our users, the best overall option will be to run Interviewer on a **laptop with a touchscreen, from one of the big manufacturers** (Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Asus).

Where these manufacturers offer different configurations, you should prioritise the quality of the display (look for displays that are as large, bright, and high resolution as possible), as well as GPU performance. Dedicated graphics will provide the best performance, but recent CPUs (such as Intel's 11th and 12th generation) provide powerful onboard graphics.
